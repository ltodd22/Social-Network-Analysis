# Social-Network-Analysis

This was an assignment for school where I analyzed an IMDB actors dataset.
The purpose was to explore how they are all connected from a Social Network Analysis perspective. For example, minimum and maximum degrees, various measures of centrality, average path length, etc.

It was all done in Python. Interestingly, adult actors tended to have the most degrees, likely due to the fact that they create more movies than average, and generally with different actors each time.

Movies in the Drama category also scored high in Betweenness Centrality. Betweenness is useful for analyzing communication dynamics. I expect that the Drama community is more tight-knit and thus more interrelated with one another.

This was a good introduction to Social Network Analysis and how we can derive insights from social network relationship data points.
